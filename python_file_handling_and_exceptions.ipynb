What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","\n","Interpreted languages execute code line by line using an interpreter, while compiled languages are converted into machine code using a compiler before execution.\n","### 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","Exception handling in Python involves using try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n","### 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","The finally block contains code that will run no matter what, even if an exception occurs. It is often used to release resources.\n","### 4. What is logging in Python?\n","\n","Logging is the process of recording messages during program execution. Python’s logging module helps track events for debugging or auditing purposes.\n","### 5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","__del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used to clean up resources like files or network connections.\n","### 6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","\n","`import module` imports the entire module, while `from module import name` imports only specific attributes or functions.\n","### 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or by grouping exceptions in a single block using a tuple.\n","### 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","\n","The with statement ensures proper resource management. It automatically closes the file even if an error occurs.\n","### 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","Multithreading runs multiple threads in a single process; multiprocessing runs separate processes. Multiprocessing avoids GIL limitations in Python.\n","### 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","Logging provides a way to trace issues, monitor execution flow, and diagnose problems without using print statements.\n","### 11. What is memory management in Python?\n","\n","Memory management in Python involves allocation and deallocation of memory automatically using reference counting and garbage collection.\n","### 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","Try the risky code in a `try` block, catch exceptions using `except`, execute optional `else`, and finalize with `finally`.\n","### 13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n","Efficient memory management prevents memory leaks and ensures optimal performance and scalability of applications.\n","### 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n","`try` defines a block of code to test for errors. `except` handles the error and prevents the program from crashing.\n","### 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n","Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to automatically manage memory and delete unused objects.\n","### 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","`else` runs only if no exception occurs in the `try` block, making logic clearer when used properly.\n","### 17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","\n","The common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n","### 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","\n","`os.fork()` creates a new process on Unix systems. `multiprocessing` is a cross-platform module for spawning processes in Python.\n","### 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","Closing a file ensures that resources are freed and data is written to disk properly.\n","### 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n","`file.read()` reads the entire file, while `file.readline()` reads one line at a time.\n","### 21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","\n","The logging module records messages that can help in debugging, auditing, and tracking events during execution.\n","### 22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","\n","The `os` module allows interaction with the operating system, such as file creation, deletion, and path handling.\n","### 23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","\n","Challenges include handling circular references and managing memory in long-running or data-intensive applications.\n","### 24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n","Use the `raise` keyword followed by an exception, e.g., `raise ValueError('Invalid input')`.\n","### 25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","\n","Multithreading can improve responsiveness and performance in I/O-bound applications like web servers or GUIs."],"metadata":{"id":"Dxsw96tvpFrH"},"id":"Dxsw96tvpFrH"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
